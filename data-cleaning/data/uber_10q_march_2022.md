## Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties - COVID-19

Various governments continue to implement, lift, and in some regions reinstate restrictions, including business activities and travel restrictions. These restrictions have had an adverse impact on Uber's business and operations by reducing global demand for Mobility offerings while accelerating the growth of Delivery offerings. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Uber's future business operations, financial position, and cash flows remains uncertain.

## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2021, Uber adopted ASU 2021-10, "Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance," which requires disclosures about transactions with a government accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on Uber's financial statements.

## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Uber is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2021-08, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers," on its consolidated financial statements. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022.

### Mobility Revenue

Uber derives revenue primarily from fees paid by Mobility Drivers for the use of its platform(s) and related services to facilitate mobility services. Mobility revenue also includes revenue from fees paid by end-users for connection services obtained via the platform.
---
# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

During the first quarter of 2022, Uber modified its arrangements in certain markets and concluded that it is responsible for providing mobility services to end-users in those markets. In these transactions, end-users are considered customers, and Uber's sole performance obligation is to provide transportation services to the end-user. Revenue is recognized when a trip is complete. In markets where Uber is responsible for mobility services, revenue from end-users is presented on a gross basis, while payments to Drivers are recognized in cost of revenue.

## Delivery Revenue

Revenue for Delivery is derived from Merchants' and Couriers' use of the platform to facilitate and complete delivery transactions. In certain markets, delivery fees charged to end-users are included in revenue, while payments to Couriers are recognized in cost of revenue.

## Freight Revenue

Freight revenue includes revenue from freight transportation services provided to shippers. Following the acquisition of Transplace, Freight revenue now also includes revenue from transportation management.

## All Other Revenue

Prior to 2022, All Other revenue primarily includes collaboration revenue related to the Advanced Technologies Group ("ATG") business and revenue from New Mobility offerings and products.

## Contract Balances and Remaining Performance Obligation

Contract liabilities represent consideration collected prior to satisfying performance obligations. As of March 31, 2022, there were $155 million of contract liabilities. Revenue recognized from these contracts during the first quarter of 2021 and 2022 was not material.

(1) For further information, see Note 4 – Equity Method Investments.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we did not make any transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.

We measure certain investments at fair value. Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.

As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of common stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.

Depending on the investee’s financing activity in a reporting period, management’s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee’s financing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee’s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.

Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (“OPM”), a common stock equivalent (“CSE”) method or a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility.

An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee’s financing transactions. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.

We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.

# Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

Non-Financial Assets

Our non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized. Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities

Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value of these securities based on valuation methods, including the CSE and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securities issued by the investee adjusted for contractual rights and obligations of the securities we hold.

We did not record any material unrealized or realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the three months ended March 31, 2021, and 2022.

|Other|$11|$13|
|Total equity method investments|$800|$624|

### MLU B.V. Investment

We reviewed for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying value of the equity method investment may not be recoverable. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we determined that our investment in MLU B.V. was other-than-temporarily impaired, and recorded an impairment charge of $182 million in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was primarily due to consensus projections of a protracted recession of the Russian economy as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To determine the fair value of our investment in MLU B.V., we utilized a market approach referencing revenue multiples from publicly traded peer companies.

MLU B.V. Basis Difference

Included in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionate share of the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V. on a one-quarter lag basis and amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for currency translation adjustments representing fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar. The Ruble depreciated against the U.S. dollar by approximately 15% between December 31, 2021, and March 31, 2022. The movement in exchange rates will be reflected in the carrying value of the investment with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss) in our condensed consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2022, as we record our share of MLU B.V.’s earnings and reflect our share of MLU B.V.'s net assets on a one-quarter lag basis.

We amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-line method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 3.1 years as of March 31, 2022. Equity method goodwill is not amortized.

## MLU B.V. Call Option

On August 30, 2021, we granted Yandex an option (“MLU B.V. Call Option”) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. The fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of March 31, 2022, is $12 million, including a $181 million gain for the fair value change during the three months ended March 31, 2022.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes to convert their notes early had been met. Therefore, the 2025 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term.

The initial conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $80.84 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special interest.

Upon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, Uber will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Uber's election. Uber may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. Uber may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at Uber's option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of Uber's common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Uber provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by Uber or any of its subsidiaries.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recorded as equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability component (the “debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity component of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not remeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as of the pricing date, Uber used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, Uber's stock price, risk free rate and volatility.

Effective January 1, 2021, Uber early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to Uber's 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the opening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021, interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.

The fair value of Uber's 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2022 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.

## Senior Notes

The 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 Senior Notes (collectively “Senior Notes”) are guaranteed by certain of Uber's material domestic restricted subsidiaries. The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants restricting Uber's and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and incur liens, as well as certain financial covenants specified in the indentures. Uber was in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2022.

Revolving Credit Arrangements:

We have a revolving credit agreement initially entered in 2015 with certain lenders, which provides for $2.3 billion in credit maturing on June 13, 2023 ("Revolving Credit Facility"). On April 4, 2022, we entered into an amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) provide for approximately $2.2 billion of revolving credit commitments, (ii) extend the maturity date for the commitments and loans from June 13, 2023 to April 4, 2027, (iii) reduce the minimum liquidity covenant from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion, (iv) replace the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") based interest rate with a Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") based interest rate, and (v) make certain other changes to the negative covenants under the amended revolving credit agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility may be guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries based on certain conditions. The credit agreement contains customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to incur debt, incur liens, and undergo certain fundamental changes, as well as maintain a certain level of liquidity specified in the contractual agreement. The credit agreement also contains customary events of default. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains restrictions on the payment of dividends. As of March 31, 2022, there was no balance outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility.

Letters of Credit:

As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, we had letters of credit outstanding of $749 million and $741 million, respectively, of which the letters of credit that reduced the available credit under the Revolving Credit Facility were $247 million and $239 million, respectively.

Equity Compensation Plans

We maintain four equity compensation plans that provide for the issuance of shares of our common stock to our officers and other employees, directors, and consultants: the 2010 Stock Plan (the “2010 Plan”), the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”), the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which have all been approved by stockholders. Following our IPO in 2019, we have only issued awards under the 2019 Plan and the ESPP, and no additional awards will be granted under the 2010 and 2013 Plans. These plans provide for the issuance of incentive stock options (“ISOs”), nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based awards, and other awards (that are based in whole or in part by reference to our common stock).

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

## Note 9 – Income Taxes

We compute our quarterly income tax expense/(benefit) by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjust for any discrete items arising during the quarter. We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $185 million and $(232) million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the income tax expense was primarily driven by current tax on foreign earnings, the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Aurora upon the sale of our ATG Business, offset by a partial benefit from U.S. losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, the benefit of U.S. losses, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, and this amount would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.

We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreign tax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For our major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom (“UK”), and Australia.

Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.

In the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), our ability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through March 31, 2022. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.

## Note 10 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.

We take into account the effect on consolidated net loss per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method.

## Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Information

We determine our operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance.

As of the first quarter of 2022, our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:

|Segment|Description|
|---|---|
|Mobility|Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Financial Partnerships and Transit offerings.|
|Delivery|Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.|
|Freight|Freight connects carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.|

For information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, refer to Note 2 – Revenue. Our segment operating performance measure is segment adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment.

Segment adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less certain expenses and excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing core operations.

### Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Reconciliation

|Segment|Three Months Ended March 31, 2021|Three Months Ended March 31, 2022|
|---|---|---|
|Mobility|$298|$618|
|Delivery|($200)|$30|
|Freight|($29)|$2|
|All Other|($11)|$0|
|Total segment adjusted EBITDA|$58|$650|

Reconciling items include various expenses leading to the loss from operations.

For detailed information, please refer to the complete quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

# Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of Uber Technologies, Inc.'s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that reflect the company's plans, estimates, and beliefs.

## Overview

Uber Technologies, Inc. is a technology platform that utilizes a vast network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to facilitate transportation and delivery services. The company connects consumers with ride services, merchants, delivery service providers, and public transportation networks. Uber is also involved in connecting shippers with carriers in the freight industry and developing new technologies to address everyday challenges.

## Driver Classification Developments

Uber is facing challenges regarding the classification of drivers in various legal proceedings globally. In California, there have been significant legal actions regarding the classification of drivers as independent contractors. While Proposition 22 in California provided a framework for drivers using platforms like Uber for independent work, legal challenges and appeals continue.

In the UK, a tribunal ruled that drivers should be classified as "workers" rather than independent contractors. This ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court, leading to historical claims settlement processes for UK drivers. Uber announced that Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage and receiving benefits such as holiday pay and pension plans.

These developments have resulted in additional expenses for Uber, including guaranteed minimum earnings for drivers, insurance for injury protection, and healthcare subsidies. The company does not expect these changes to have a material impact on its business, financial position, or cash flows.

Uber continues to navigate legal challenges and regulatory changes related to driver classification in various jurisdictions.
---
# Uber Quarterly Report

# Uber Quarterly Report

Claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a settlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place in 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.

On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. We have completed the enrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.

If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Any of these events could negatively impact our business, result of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

For a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial position and operating condition and cash flows, see the risk factor titled “-Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees” included in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

The quarter-over-quarter decline in MAPCs was related to a slower start to the first quarter of 2022 due to impacts from the Omicron variant of COVID-19, followed by consumer activity increases through the remainder of the first quarter of 2022 with the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility ride or received a Delivery order on our platform increasing from 111 million in January 2022 to 121 million in March 2022.

Business model changes in the UK that classify certain payments and incentives as cost of revenue also benefited Mobility revenue by $200 million. Additionally, Mobility revenue in the first quarter of 2021 was impacted by a $600 million accrual made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the classification of drivers.

** Percentage not meaningful.

Adjusted EBITDA was $168 million, improving $527 million from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $359 million in the same period in 2021. The improvement was primarily attributable to a $320 million increase in Mobility Adjusted EBITDA, a $230 million improvement in Delivery Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a $31 million increase in Freight Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by a $65 million increase in Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs.

Take Rate is an operating metric and defined as revenue as a percentage of Gross Bookings.

# Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.

We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

## Adjusted EBITDA

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding various items such as income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and other specified items. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions. It provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results.

To help assess the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations, we are excluding certain COVID-19 response initiatives related payments and costs from Adjusted EBITDA.

### COVID-19 Response Initiatives

To support those affected by COVID-19, we have implemented initiatives including financial assistance to Drivers, distribution of personal protective equipment, free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers and others in need, as well as charitable donations. These initiatives are recorded accordingly in our financial statements.

### Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation

Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure and should be considered as supplemental. It does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements and may not include certain non-cash charges. It is not a substitute for GAAP financial information.

|Net cash used in investing activities|$(250) million|$(135) million|
|Net cash used in financing activities|$(226) million|$(113) million|

## Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $5.9 billion of net loss, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included $5.6 billion in unrealized losses from equity securities, $359 million of stock-based compensation expense and $254 million depreciation and amortization as well as a $27 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital primarily driven by an increase in our accrued insurance reserves.

Net cash used in operating activities was $611 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $122 million of net loss, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included $1.7 billion gain on business divestiture and $281 million of stock-based compensation expense as well as a $412 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses and other current liabilities.

## Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $135 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $62 million in purchases of property and equipment and $59 million in acquisition of business, net of cash acquired.

Net cash used in investing activities was $250 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $803 million in purchases of non-marketable equity securities, $336 million in purchases of marketable securities and $216 million in purchases of a note receivable, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $696 million and $500 million in proceeds from the sale of non-marketable equity securities.

## Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $113 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $62 million of principal payments on finance leases.

Net cash used in financing activities was $226 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $194 million of principal repayment on Careem Notes.

## Other Information

As of March 31, 2022, $2.2 billion of Uber's $4.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. Uber believes that its existing cash balance in the United States is sufficient to fund its working capital needs in the country. Uber is in compliance with its debt and line of credit covenants as of March 31, 2022, and believes that its sources of funding and available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months.

## Purchase Commitments

As of March 31, 2022, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the contractual obligations disclosed in Uber's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

## Critical Accounting Estimates

Uber's condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and require estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates, impacting future financial statements.

## ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:

### Interest Rate Risk

Our exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 million as of March 31, 2022.

### Investment Risk

Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We did not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments.

### Foreign Currency Risk

We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.

We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency rates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.

## ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

### Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

## Management Discussion and Analysis

Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.

### Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We acquired Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”) in November 2021. As part of our ongoing evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, we are reviewing the internal controls of Transplace and are making appropriate changes as we deem necessary. Other than the controls related to Transplace, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

### Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.

## Risks Related to Our Business

### General Economic Risks

The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governments around the world have implemented, lifted, and in some regions reinstated travel restrictions, business restrictions, school closures, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions have been lifted and many regions around the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility

### Other Risks

- We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances, including COVID-19.
- We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or such technologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles.
- Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.
- We may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.
- Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.
- We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.
- We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.
- We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.
- We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.
- If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.
- We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.
- Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.
- Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.
- We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.
- If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.
- The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

## Operational Risks

Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.

The classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’ platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.

Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.

In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $414 million as of March 31, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.

Changes to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.

In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.
---
# Uber Quarterly Report

# Uber Quarterly Report

We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Another example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather than self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court’s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as “workers” under UK labor law, going forward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid holiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.

In addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.

In addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these industries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.

Our platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of orders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.

Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and service fees have negatively affected and will continue to negatively affect Uber's financial performance. Pricing models for consumer fares and Driver earnings have been modified over time and may be modified in the future, impacting the success of attracting consumers and Drivers. Changes in pricing models and strategies, as well as competitive pressures, may lead to the need to maintain or lower fares, service fees, or increase Driver incentives and consumer discounts.

Uber has incurred significant losses since inception, with operating losses of $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2021. As of March 31, 2022, Uber had an accumulated deficit of $29.6 billion. Operating expenses are expected to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and profitability may not be achieved or maintained.

Success in geographic markets depends on maintaining or increasing network scale and liquidity by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to the platform. Driver supply constraints, impacted by factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect liquidity network effects. Similarly, attracting and maintaining a critical mass of platform users is crucial for financial results.

Overall, Uber faces challenges in managing pricing models, competition, operating expenses, and attracting and maintaining platform users, which may impact financial performance and profitability in the future.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.

We have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueled distrust of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made it difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.

In 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.

Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.

While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs, maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may in the future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize compliance, has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally. Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote transparency and collaboration, regulators may continue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Our historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing, causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, Uber operated in approximately 72 countries, with markets outside the United States accounting for about 75% of all Trips. The company has limited experience in many international jurisdictions and has been investing significantly to expand its global operations and compete with local and global competitors.

Operating internationally poses various risks that are not as prevalent in the United States. Some of these risks include operational and compliance challenges due to distance, language, and cultural differences, adapting to local laws and regulations, competition with local services, managing international operations and staffing, currency exchange fluctuations, tax consequences, financial reporting complexities, and geopolitical instability.

Additionally, conducting business in foreign markets exposes Uber to legal uncertainties, differing levels of social acceptance, technological compatibility issues, and challenges related to managing cash transactions, credit risk, and payment fraud. The company also faces difficulties in implementing and maintaining financial systems across multiple jurisdictions and complying with import/export restrictions and trade regulations.

The company acknowledges that political, social, and economic instability, terrorist threats, and security concerns can impact its operations and disrupt the global economy. Uber also highlights the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as a specific geopolitical risk that could affect its business.

In conclusion, Uber's international expansion strategy comes with various challenges and risks that require careful management and adaptation to local market conditions and regulations.

# Uber Quarterly Report

This document contains information about risks and challenges faced by Uber Technologies, Inc. as outlined in their quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

One of the risks highlighted is the impact of public health concerns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on international operations. Additionally, reduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain markets poses a threat to the company's business and financial condition.

Uber's ownership in minority-owned affiliates, including Didi, Grab, Zomato, and others, presents risks as the company may not have control over the decisions made by these entities. Any decline in the business of these affiliates could adversely affect Uber's financial results.

The document also mentions restrictions on selling or transferring assets, such as a 4-year lock-up period for shares in Aurora. The lack of a public market for these securities may impact Uber's ability to realize the long-term value of these assets.

Overall, the risks associated with international operations, ownership in affiliates, and asset transfers could have a significant impact on Uber's business, financial condition, and operating results.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.

Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.

For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain cities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.

If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results and future prospects.

Our Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that they will continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and our ability to:

- grow supply and demand on our platform;
- increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform;
- continue to introduce our platform to new markets;
- provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;
- expand our business and increase our market share and category position;
- compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;
- develop new products, offerings, and technologies;
- identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;
- penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;
- reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;
- maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;
- enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and
- increase positive perception of our brand.

We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming from continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties,

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This document contains information about Uber Technologies, Inc.'s financial performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

Below is an excerpt from the report:

Failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve profitability.

In 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas.

Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient.

In 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our operating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from airports.

If we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.

We have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform.

This document contains information about Uber Technologies, Inc.'s performance for a specific quarter, including unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

Below are some key points from the report:

1. Multiple Accounts: Uber believes that there are consumers with multiple accounts, which is prohibited in their Terms of Service. Measures are in place to detect and prevent such behavior.

2. Use of Cash: In certain jurisdictions, consumers can pay for rides and deliveries using cash, raising regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. Cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of global Gross Bookings in 2021.

3. Credit Card Acceptance: 74% of Gross Bookings in 2021 were paid by credit or debit cards. Loss of credit card acceptance privileges could significantly impact Uber's business model.

4. Cybersecurity: Uber faces risks from cyberattacks such as malware, ransomware, viruses, and phishing attacks, which could harm the company's reputation.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This document contains information about the business operations and financial results of Uber Technologies, Inc. for the specific quarter.

Below are some key points regarding cybersecurity risks and system errors mentioned in the report:

## Cybersecurity Risks:

Uber Technologies, Inc. relies heavily on information technology systems that contain proprietary and confidential information. Cyberattacks, including malware, ransomware, and phishing, pose a significant threat to the security of the company's systems and platforms. Breaches in security could lead to data loss, intellectual property theft, and reputational harm.

Various factors, such as system failures, power outages, and human errors, may also contribute to security breaches. The company faces the challenge of protecting data and preventing unauthorized access to its systems.

## System Errors:

Uber's platform is a complex system with interconnected components, making it susceptible to undetected errors and bugs. Software vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and unintended interactions between systems could result in compliance issues and service downtime for platform users.

Discovering defects in the software after release may lead to interruptions in platform availability and negative experiences for users. The company's use of artificial intelligence introduces additional risks related to flawed algorithms and biased data.

Overall, addressing cybersecurity risks and system errors is crucial for maintaining the performance, reliability, and security of Uber's products and services.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.

## Climate Change Risks

Uber faces climate change related physical and transition risks, such as market shifts toward electric vehicles and lower carbon business models, as well as risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events have the potential to disrupt Uber's business, suppliers, and stakeholders using the platform.

### Climate Commitments

Uber has made climate-related commitments, including transitioning to 100% renewable electricity for U.S. offices by 2025 and achieving net zero climate emissions by 2030. The company recognizes the need to invest significant resources and management time to meet these commitments.

## Dependencies on Third Parties

Uber's business relies on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under its control. Disruptions in these infrastructures could impact the speed and availability of the platform, affecting user experience and revenue.

### Third-Party Marketplaces

Uber's platform depends on third parties maintaining open marketplaces for distribution. Any interference with the distribution of Uber's products or offerings could adversely affect the business.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This document contains information about the financial performance of Uber Technologies, Inc. for a specific quarter.

## Financing and Transactional Risks

Uber Technologies, Inc. may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.

To effectively compete, Uber may need additional funds to invest in new products, offerings, and markets. Raising additional funds through equity or debt securities may lead to dilution for existing stockholders. Existing debt instruments and potential future debt financing could contain restrictive covenants affecting the company's ability to obtain additional capital.

As of March 31, 2022, Uber had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4 billion aggregate principal amount. Additional debt may be incurred in the future, potentially limiting available funds and restricting operational flexibility.

## Third-Party Open Source Software Risks

Uber utilizes third-party open source software in platform development, which could pose risks related to compliance with open source licenses and potential litigation.

Challenges may arise from claims of non-compliance with open source licenses, leading to the exposure of proprietary source code or the need for significant resources to address such claims. The use of open source software may also increase security risks and limit intellectual property protection.

Any issues related to third-party open source software could negatively impact Uber's business, financial condition, and operating results, potentially aiding competitors in developing similar or superior products.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.

In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.

In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the section titled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.” We may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities.

The tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different companies. For example, we may become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we currently pay in those jurisdictions. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Currently, certain jurisdictions are investigating our compliance with tax rules. If it is determined that we are not compliant with such rules, we could owe additional taxes.

Certain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters are being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes; even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.

Additionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax authorities, and currently face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financial position and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by our management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future, which could impact our financial position. In addition, in connection with any planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire businesses that have differing licenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm’s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than our licenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financial statements, and could adversely affect our financial results.

## Changes in Global and U.S. Tax Legislation

Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect Uber's financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations, and uncertainties remain regarding its impact on state and local taxation. The Act also eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period, which could impact Uber's financials.

## Impact of Future Tax Reforms

Uber is unable to predict the effects of future global or U.S. tax reforms on its business. Any changes in tax legislation could increase tax liabilities, affect financial position, operating results, and cash flows, and increase the complexity of tax compliance. Uber may also be subject to digital services taxes in jurisdictions where it operates, further impacting its tax obligations.

## Limitations on Tax Attributes

Uber's ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited. The expiration of carryforwards could affect future income tax liabilities, and ownership changes could restrict the use of pre-ownership change tax attributes, potentially increasing future tax liability.

## Exposure to Currency Exchange Rates

Uber faces exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates due to conducting business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These fluctuations can impact financial results when translated into U.S. dollars. While Uber may use hedging arrangements to manage currency risks, such activities come with inherent risks that could affect financial condition and operating results.

## Acquisitions and Integration Risks

Uber's strategy includes acquiring businesses, and the success of these acquisitions is crucial. Failure to identify, acquire, and integrate suitable businesses could harm operating results and prospects. Acquired businesses may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated, posing additional risks to Uber.

# Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Uber's Business

Uber Technologies, Inc. faces various legal and regulatory risks in different jurisdictions that may impact its operations and financial performance. Some of the key points include:

## Business Model Challenges in Certain Jurisdictions

In expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, Uber's ridesharing business model has faced obstacles such as being blocked, capped, or suspended due to regulatory restrictions. Uber has had to adapt its business model in response to laws in these jurisdictions.

## Impact of Regulatory Changes

Regulatory changes, such as minimum wait times for ridesharing drivers in Barcelona and minimum trip payment formulas in New York City, have affected Uber's financial performance. The company has also faced regulatory scrutiny and freezes on for-hire vehicle licenses in various cities.

## Legal Challenges and Compliance Issues

Uber has encountered legal challenges in jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Colombia, where court rulings and competition laws have impacted its operations. The company has had to make changes to its products and offerings to comply with local regulations.

Continued operation in jurisdictions with ambiguous or challenging laws may result in fines, penalties, and risks to Uber's licenses or permits. These legal and regulatory risks pose challenges to Uber's business growth and financial performance.

# Uber Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

As of March 31, 2022, Uber's platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries. The company faces regulatory obstacles globally, including challenges from local governments and competitors. These obstacles may impact Uber's operations and revenue.

## Legal and Regulatory Risks

Uber is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could adversely affect its business and future prospects. The company is actively challenging laws and regulations that restrict its operations and lobbying against such restrictions.

## Impact of Brexit

Effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union ("EU"), known as Brexit. The UK represented approximately 8.9% of Uber's global Mobility Gross Bookings in the first quarter of 2022.

## Litigation

Uber is involved in litigation in various jurisdictions, including challenges to laws and regulations, claims from stakeholders, and class action lawsuits. Legal proceedings are costly and time-consuming and could result in financial damages or penalties if resolved adversely.

## Dockless E-Bikes and E-Scooters

Although Uber divested certain assets of its dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers still have access to these services through the Uber app. The operation of dockless e-bikes and e-scooters poses additional risks distinct from other offerings.

For more detailed information, please refer to the full quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Below are some excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):

Using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The occurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative publicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.

Changes in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. Competition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.

Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services. Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions.

Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to Strong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction.

For more detailed information, please refer to the full quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the SEC.

This document contains excerpts from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It provides insights into the company's financial performance and related risks.

## Payment Processing and Regulatory Compliance

The report highlights the importance of compliance with evolving laws related to money transmission and online payments. Changes in regulations could impact Uber's ability to provide payment processing services on its platform. The transition of payment operations to Uber Payments B.V. in the EEA countries is noted as a response to European payments regulations.

## Legal Inquiries and Investigations

Uber is currently facing inquiries and investigations from various government agencies, including the DOJ and state Attorney General offices. These inquiries cover a range of matters such as business practices, data privacy incidents, and regulatory compliance. Settlements and fines related to past breaches and incidents are also mentioned, indicating potential financial and reputational risks.

## Government Enforcement Actions

The document outlines the potential consequences of government enforcement actions, including fines, penalties, and sanctions. The impact of regulatory investigations on Uber's business operations and user trust is emphasized, along with the need for substantial resources to address legal challenges.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This document contains information about the risks faced by Uber Technologies, Inc. related to data privacy and security.

Uber Technologies, Inc. is exposed to various risks including:

- Potential financial damages and operational restrictions due to regulatory investigations
- Risks related to data collection, use, and processing leading to investigations, litigation, and fines
- Potential civil lawsuits in the United States related to data breaches
- Violations of privacy and data protection laws resulting in legal actions and penalties

Uber Technologies, Inc. has faced regulatory actions and fines in various jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, for privacy violations and data security incidents.

The company is subject to laws such as the GDPR in the EU and the CCPA in California, which impose strict requirements on data processing and privacy practices.

Non-compliance with these laws can lead to significant penalties, fines, and injunctions against data processing.

As Uber Technologies, Inc. expands its operations globally, it may face increased compliance costs and risks associated with evolving privacy and data security regulations.
---
# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.

Such data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.

Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.

We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We are subject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees.

Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries, investigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.

We have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA and other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to additional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties.

Our activities in certain countries with high levels of corruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or business partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control.

Our acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be familiar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws.

Drivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our platform.

Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company.

We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.

We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs.

Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. - Quarterly Report

This document contains information from the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Below are some key points from the report:

## Insurance Reserves and Liability

Uber and its captive insurance subsidiary have reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer risk, potentially requiring payment of material amounts exceeding insurance reserves.

Claims of liability from accidents or incidents involving drivers on the platform could lead to financial harm and negative publicity.

## Regulatory Compliance

Uber is subject to local laws and regulations regarding insurance coverage, which could result in legal actions or penalties if not complied with.

Pricing regulations and related litigation or inquiries may impact Uber's revenue and operating costs.

## Intellectual Property Protection

Uber's intellectual property, including trademarks, patents, and trade secrets, is crucial for its competitive advantage. Failure to protect intellectual property could harm the business.

Efforts are made to safeguard intellectual property through legal protections, agreements, and control of proprietary information.

For more detailed information, please refer to the complete quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the SEC.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. The report includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

## Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock

The market price of Uber's common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly due to various factors beyond the company's control. These factors include:

- Fluctuations in MAPCs, Trips, Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Bookings, revenue, or other financial results
- Announcements or estimates of changes in the number of Drivers and consumers on the platform
- Differences between actual operating results and expectations of management, analysts, and investors
- Changes in accounting principles or interpretations
- Actions of securities analysts and changes in financial estimates
- Announcements by Uber or competitors regarding products, features, acquisitions, partnerships, or capital commitments
- Negative media coverage
- Changes in stock market valuations of technology companies
- Lawsuits, legislation, regulatory actions, or developments impacting operations
- Changes in board of directors or management

Stock price volatility can be unrelated to operating performance, leading to potential securities litigation and significant impact on Uber's business.

## Delaware Law and Corporate Provisions

Delaware law and provisions in Uber's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make mergers, tender offers, or proxy contests challenging, potentially affecting the trading price of the company's common stock.

Source: Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following:

- Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill vacancies created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;
- Advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals, which may reduce the number of stockholder proposals available for stockholder consideration;
- Limitations on stockholder ability to convene special stockholder meetings, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to adopt desired governance changes;
- Prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and
- Our board of directors is able to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.

Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. In addition, under our existing debt instruments, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, are subject to certain limitations on our business and operations, including limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets. For information regarding these and other provisions, see the risk factor titled “-We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.”

Sales, directly or indirectly, of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.

Sales, directly or indirectly, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the public perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. Such issuances, including the issuance of additional shares of our common stock upon exercise of such equity awards, could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.

We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, certain of our existing debt instruments include restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:

- Any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;
- Any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;
- Any action asserting a claim against us or our directors, officers, or employees arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;
- Any action regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;
- Any action as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and
- Any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. Although the Delaware Supreme Court has held that such exclusive forum provisions are facially valid, courts in other jurisdictions may find such provisions to be unenforceable.

These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If any other court of competent jurisdiction were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.

## General Risk Factors

As a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.

We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to disclose changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.

The process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly and challenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in size and complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required for a public company. During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.

We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growth offerings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these and other effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.
